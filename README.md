# Assign-7
Create a "simple" and "complex" hash table with the capabilities to insert, remove, and retrieve a value which are obtained from the command line. The simple hash table overrides previous values, whereas the complex one calculates a new key until its value is empty (double-hash technique).

The driver file tests both the simple and complex hash table functions.
If words aren't passed into the command line, then the world "hello" will be used as a default to test the functions.
